As you progress through your journey as a developer you might aspire to go up the ranks of career progression. At most places the career progression resembles intern > junior > mid-level or just plain developer (just plain yogurt… spaceballs anyone?) > senior > principal > senior principal. At some places you may transition into more of an architect role. This assumes you want to stay doing mostly coding and not enter the manager progression. Of course, different places call these ranks different names or split them up more like Microsoft’s SDEs with numbers

I’m squarely in the Senior rank, but I’ve got a friend who’s on that edge between mid-level and senior and we’ve been talking about what it means to be a senior developer. Even though getting a new title will make the transition seem very clear cut, the reality is far from it. It’s a slow transition and there are going to be times where you show Senior developer values and times when you show mid-level values. For me I see the real difference in terms of your place in the team and projects. A senior dev is going to be leading at least one project as well as mentoring your team members. Now this doesn’t mean you’re their manager, but you should take the lead in becoming an expert in a certain area or a new technology. As needed you can then share that expertise.

As a lead dev on a team you’ll be making sure the other team members know what needs to be worked on, why, and when it needs to be done. You’ll be communicating with other roles in the team like BA, QA, and product manager about requirements, challenges that arise, pivots that need to be made, etc. However there will be times when you can’t really express that senior dev role as much. You might be in a smaller team with two senior devs or maybe it’s just you. Maybe you're not really working on a project right now but handling some bug tickets or doing maintenance work. That’s alright, just keep learning and trying to help others out.

When it comes to representing yourself as a senior developer to others that don’t know you well via a resume, LinkedIn, and interview, I think there are a few tips that can help. 1.

1.  Obviously having a “Senior ____” title can help
    
2.  The amount of years you’ve worked someplace is another factor. Someone who has worked as a mid-level developer for 2-3 or even up to 5 years would be expected to receive a Senior title, but you also have to earn it by doing all those things we talked about above. Someone who’s worked in the same job for 10 years but has yet to take the lead or really do anything but be a code monkey doesn’t deserve a Senior title in my eyes.
    
3.  Show and talk about what you’ve done that you believe justifies that title. What projects have you worked on, how did you lead the team, did you meet the deadline, who have you mentored, etc.
    
4.  If you’re doing step 3 adequately almost by definition you don’t have time and space (on a resume) to talk about smaller and lesser things. Don’t worry about your education, the scholarships you got, your first job out of high school, etc. At this point you’re so far from that. You already got the mid-level developer job. Everyone knows you can code and they know how smart you are by the technology you’re choosing to use, the development methodologies, the architecture of your projects and your code, and by talking with you.
    
5.  It can be easy to fall back into code monkey mode as a developer and assume that people only care about technology stacks. While mentioning the technology stack is important you need to balance that with talking about your soft skills. Some hiring managers may not be that technical and they need to know if you can fit into a team, communicate effectively, and if you manage your time and personal life effectively. I’ve interviewed many programmers that were smart enough but didn’t seem like a great fit for our team. Also, don’t go too in depth on technologies, keep it high level.
    

Hope that helps anyone who is looking to transition into a senior role or wondering if they’re already fulfilling a senior role. It’s definitely not black and white. Even if you have the title in one company that doesn’t mean you’ll get it in another. Just because you have the title doesn’t mean you earned it either.

Sometime soon I hope to write about becoming a Principal Developer and what that means to me.

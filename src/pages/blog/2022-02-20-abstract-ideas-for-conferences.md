I'm going to submit some abstracts for the That Conference coming in July at the Wisconsin Dells. I wrote up a first draft of a few abstracts for sessions to submit to the That Conference as well as some other conferences potentially, and I'm looking for feedback on these abstracts. Any feedback either positive or negative would be appreciated. Please and Thank you :)

## Minecraft modding 
*kid friendly*

#### Title: 
Minecraft But With {You Decide}! Let‚Äôs Mod You Some Minecraft ‚öíÔ∏èüß±

#### Short Description: 
If you‚Äôve ever looked at the Youtube Trending section you‚Äôve seen many videos with titles like ‚ÄúMinecraft but you can craft Infinity Stones‚Äù. Minecraft mods have kept minecraft relevant by allowing enthusiasts to make the game do whatever they want. We‚Äôre going to be making our own simple mod, which will set the stage for you to build your own blocks, crafting recipes, tools, armor, mobs, game rules, etc. There‚Äôs a lot that we need to do to get to the point of playing our mod, so this will be a fast-paced session.

Minecraft mods have kept minecraft relevant by allowing enthusiasts to make the game do whatever they want. I love playing modpacks like Feed The Beast that combine a bunch of great mods that give you the ability to cast magic with ruins, travel to other planes, make nuclear reactors, and so much more. If you‚Äôve ever thought of something cool that you‚Äôd like to do that can‚Äôt be done in vanilla minecraft this session will teach you the basics to make that a reality.

We‚Äôre going to be making our own simple mod, which will set the stage for you to build your own blocks, crafting recipes, tools, armor, mobs, game rules, etc. There‚Äôs a lot that we need to do to get to the point of playing our mod, so this will be a fast-paced session. However as long as you have the prerequisite tools installed you should be able to follow along. This session is targeted towards Professionals, Teachers, and Parents, but could be slow down for kids


## Home Assistant
#### Title: 
üè°Build an Automated Home of the Future using Home Assistant hub on Docker üêã

#### Short Description: 
IoT devices that we can buy off the shelf are a great way to automate your home, but you‚Äôre either investing all into one system or have a hodgepodge of devices that can be hard to get working together. Thanks to Home Assistant we can connect multiple different types of IoT devices and configure them so data from one device can influence the behavior of another device. We‚Äôll use Docker to host this on existing hardware, but a lot of the tips in this session will apply to Home Assistant OS.

#### Long Description: 
We recently went to Disney World and rode on the Carousel of Progress. In that ride we see the great advancements the world has made, but also a vision of the future (in 1964). There‚Äôs a connected home with a voice assistant that uses devices around the house to do things for the family. With the IoT devices available on the market today we can have that home of the future.

## Content Creation
#### Title: 
Stop Hiding Your Talents From the World! Start Creating Content to Get Exposure, Make More $$, and Help People at the Same Time ‚ù§Ô∏è

#### Short Description: 
If you‚Äôre not creating content then you‚Äôre hiding your talents from the world. My philosophy is you can be the greatest programmer in the world but if no one knows who you are and what you do, you‚Äôll never get new opportunities. Those opportunities could lead to learning cool tech, meeting interesting people, and making more $$. The best part is it‚Äôs a mutualistic relationship. You can help people by sharing your expertise. In this session I‚Äôll share some lessons I‚Äôve learned in becoming an amateur content creator and talk about all the ways you can get started creating content as well.

In order to build a personal brand you need to figure out what your area of expertise is,  what sets you apart from other people you know in similar roles, and what do you want to be known for to the hiring managers and recruiters out there. You need to find your audience, which at first means trying a lot of different ideas and seeing what people respond to. We‚Äôll talk about creating content on all social media platforms (including That.us), when to spend money and when not to, and how to network to promote your content. 

If it seems a bit intimidating remember that something is better than nothing and you can always change. Branding isn‚Äôt just for companies and your personal brand can lead you to exciting opportunities while helping give back to the community.

Coming Soon...

[The Coding Canal Podcast](https://anchor.fm/jesse-dahir-kanehl) is a podcast where I talk to interesting people that an Azure and .Net developer like me would be interested in.

In this coming episode of the Coding Canal I talk to Sam Nasr about Azure Cognitive Services and I ask him a bunch of questions about AI/ML. Enjoy!

You can reach me on all platforms @TheCodingCanal
